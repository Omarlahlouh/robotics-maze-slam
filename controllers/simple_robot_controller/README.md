# Path Planning Module – A* Navigation (Author: Ziad Tarek)

This module implements the path–planning and navigation logic used by the robot after
the SLAM map is built. It is responsible for finding a collision-free route to the exit
and generating smooth waypoints that the controller can follow.


## 1. A* Path Planning
The planner uses an A* search on the occupancy grid generated by SLAM.  
Key features:
- Converts world coordinates to grid indices.
- Checks obstacle probability and avoids unsafe cells.
- Applies a safety margin so the robot does not drive too close to walls.
- Uses a priority queue (min-heap) to expand the most promising node.

The planner returns a list of grid cells which is later converted into world-space waypoints.


## 2. Path Simplification
After the raw A* path is generated, redundant waypoints are removed by checking  
direction changes between consecutive points.  
Only meaningful turning points are kept, which reduces:
- Unnecessary zig-zag behaviour  
- Excessive turning  


## 3. Corner Smoothing
Sharp corners are replaced by intermediate smoothing points to make motion more stable.  
This helps prevent sudden angular velocity spikes and improves turning behaviour inside narrow corridors.


## 4. Waypoint Following Controller
The controller computes linear and angular velocity commands based on:
- distance to the current waypoint  
- heading error  
- upcoming corner detection  

The robot slows down before turns and speeds up on straight segments, producing smoother navigation.


### Contribution
This entire path planning module — A*, path simplification, corner smoothing,  
and waypoint-following logic — was designed and implemented by **Ziad Tarek**.
